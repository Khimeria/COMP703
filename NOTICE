Touched fields - Trigonometry and algebra: meshes and renderers, camera and player controller, lights, colors materials and textures
Physics - 1s Newton low, optimization using pointers, management of buffers and shader codding.

Result- a simple navigatable game, where you should survive running from troll, one touch and you wil die)
also be careful with environment you can stack)

Good luck!
