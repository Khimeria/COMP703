CMake Warning at tests/CMakeLists.txt:1 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbenchmark.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "benchmark", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "benchmark" with
  any of the following names:

    benchmarkConfig.cmake
    benchmark-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "benchmark" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "benchmark_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "benchmark" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
